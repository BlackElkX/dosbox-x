### What is DOSBox-X?

DOSBox-X is an open-source DOS emulator for running DOS applications and games.

DOS-based Windows such as Windows 3.x and Windows 9x are officially supported.

Compared to DOSBox, DOSBox-X is much more flexible and [provides more features](wiki/DOSBox%E2%80%90X%E2%80%99s-Feature-Highlights){:target="_blank"}.

Look at the [DOSBox-X Wiki](wiki/) for more information about DOSBox-X and usage guides.

We also hope that DOSBox-X (along with DOSLIB) can [aid in new DOS development](newdosdevelopment.html).
