I know that it's not obvious from the commit log, the git repository, or the project itself, but there's a lot of interesting work and discovery in working on DOSBox-X.

The purpose of this blog is to document these discoveries and notes.

This blog will eventually get a proper web design layout. Putting up content however, is more important than making it look pretty.

Despite the name of the blog, this will also cover DOSLIB development as well. DOSLIB and DOSBox-X are developed in parallel to improve emulation and document the behavior of actual hardware.
