<div><span style="font-weight: 600">DOSBox-X</span> is a DOS emulator derived from DOSBox that is designed to support <span style="font-weight: 600">different types of DOS software and systems</span>, including serious and professional use-cases (such as those requiring printing and SHARE functions) and East Asian systems (such as DOS/V and PC-98). It focuses on implementing <span style="font-weight: 600">accurate emulations</span> (especially accurate reproduction of hardware behavior) and various ways to configure the DOS virtual machine, and also intends to be a great platform for emulating <span style="font-weight: 600">DOS-based Windows</span> such as Windows 3.x and 9x/ME and software written for those versions of Windows. DOSBox-X implements various features needed by DOS programs and also to support the <span style="font-weight: 600"><a href="newdosdevelopment.html">development of new DOS software</a></span> (in combination with <a href="https://github.com/joncampbell123/doslib">DOSLIB</a>/<a href="https://github.com/joncampbell123/doslib2">DOSLIB2</a> and <a href="http://hackipedia.org/">Hackipedia</a>).<p />

<h3>Goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>Implement features needed by DOS software and DOS-based Windows, including usages of serious and business DOS applications</li>

<li>Implement DOS systems covering all pre-2000 DOS and Windows 9x based hardware scenarios, including all manner of hardware</li>

<li>Implement configuration parameters to configure the DOS virtual machine, whatever take to get the DOS game or program to run</li>

<li>Implement emulation accurate enough to help new DOS developments with confidence programs run properly on actual DOS systems</li>

<li>Improve usability and try to make DOSBox-X work consistently on all supported platforms (especially Windows, Linux, and macOS)</li>

<li>Being a great platform for emulating Windows 3.x/9x/ME and software written for these Windows versions (with full acceleration)</li>

<li>Grow the team by welcoming and supporting new contributors to help with its developments (such as coding and documentation)</li>

<li>Leverage continued DOS developments by helping, supporting and encouraging developers to write new DOS games or programs</li>

<li>Leverage and collaborate with the upstream DOSBox project and other derived projects, such as the DOSBox Staging project</li>
</ul>

<h3>Non-goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>Giving the best experience to DOS gamers who desire good performance, or being the fastest DOS emulator on x86 hardware</li>

<li>Adopting changes that would clearly impair the emulation accuracy, or otherwise conflict with the project goals</li>

<li>Adopting most recent development tools and systems (such as rigorous code review, CI and Meson build systems)</li>

<li>Implementing features not necessary by the emulator, if they cause major issues or code maintainability concerns</li>

<li>Supporting Pentium II or higher CPU level emulation (unless desired by the DOSBox-X community in general)</li>

<li>Emulation of PC hardware after 2000, when the updated "PC 2001" specifications were published in 2001</li>

<li>Emulation of DOS systems other than IBM PC/XT/AT, Amstrad, Tandy, PCjr, JEGA/AX, and PC-98 (with exceptions)</li>

<li>Windows guest emulation, Windows XP or later (these versions of Windows are not DOS-based, unlike Win3.x/9x/ME)</li>

<li>Acting as a standalone DOS operating system like FreeDOS, although you can run DOS images inside the emulator</li>
</ul>
