<h2 id="_dosbox_xs_feature_highlights">DOSBox-X’s Feature Highlights</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a cross-platform DOS emulator, DOSBox-X officially supports different types of DOS software, including DOS applications, Windows 3.x and 9x/Me, in addition to DOS games (which are the focus of original DOSBox). Compared with DOSBox, DOSBox-X focuses more on general emulation and accuracy, supporting more subareas of DOS including East Asian systems and languages (such as DOS/V and NEC PC-98 emulation). While incorporating virtually all existing features of DOSBox, DOSBox-X provides many more for different purposes. Examples of DOSBox-X&#8217;s unique features include (note that these are just examples):</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>GUI drop-down menu for easier usage</strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DOSBox-X features a drop-down menu system so that you can do many things from the GUI menu instead of typing commands or so. The menu can also be toggled on and off.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Built-in graphical configuration tool</strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can configure DOSBox-X‘s settings directly from its built-in GUI configuration tool instead of having to manually modify its config file (you can use either way).</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Save and load state support (with save slots and save files)</strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DOSBox-X provides a fully-featured system for saving and loading states with support for up to 100 save slots, selectable from the menu, as well as the option to use your own save files. You can also let DOSBox-X save states automatically for specific programs and/or in user-defined intervals.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automatic image file and drive mounting</strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For image files, DOSBox-X allows you to mount them automatically without specifying additional options such as -size and -t. And for drive mounting on Windows, DOSBox-X automatically asks you mount a drive if you try to enter a drive which is not yet mounted, and you can also let DOSBox-X automatically mount all available Windows drives at start.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Japanese NEC PC-98, AX, and J-3100 emulations</strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With DOSBox-X you can run the Japanese PC-98 system and PC-98 games and applications, as well as the Japanese AX (JEGA) and J-3100 systems. Set <code>machine=pc98</code> or <code>machine=jega</code> in the config file to start DOSBox-X in the PC-98 or JEGA mode. Look at the <a href="Guide%3APC‐98-emulation-in-DOSBox‐X">PC‐98 emulation in DOSBox‐X</a> guide page for more information about PC-98 support.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for native DOS/V service emulations</strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DOSBox-X implements native DOS/V services for Chinese/Japanese/Korean language support, so that are these languages can be displayed without any external tools. Set <code>dosv</code> to <code>jp</code>, <code>chs</code> (or <code>cn</code>), <code>cht</code> (or <code>tw</code>), or <code>ko</code> for different CJK languages. Look at the <a href="Guide%3AEast-Asian-language-support-in-DOSBox‐X">East Asian language support in DOSBox‐X</a> guide page for more information about support for East Asian languages and systems.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for SDL2 in addition to SDL1</strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DOSBox-X officially supports both SDL1 and SDL2 and provides both SDL1 and SDL2 builds, so that you can choose either the SDL1 or SDL2 build to use. While most features are common to both SDL builds, certain functions may only be found in one of them.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fully translatable user interfaces</strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DOSBox-X allows you to translate its various user interfaces, including text in the DOS window, the drop-down menus, the graphical Configuration Tool and the Mapper Editor. Both standard SBCS languages and DBCS languages are supported. Several language files can be found in the repository and are ready to use.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>More customizable virtual machine</strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DOSBox-X provides many more config options that are not found in DOSBox, so that users have more options to customize the virtual machine inside DOSBox-X. For example, you can skip the splash screen and the welcome banner, or even starting DOSBox-X in silent mode (<code>-silent</code>), along with a lot more.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CPU speed optimization and Turbo mode</strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DOSBox-X can automatically decide the CPU cycles to use for optimized speed, and it provides a Turbo function to increase the speed of the system inside it, which can be toggled at run-time.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved customization on the title bar</strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DOSBox-X allows you to modify or customize the strings and additional contents displayed in its title bar and its appearance. The cycles count (FPS) and emulation speed relative to real-time can also be displayed in the title bar.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Better compatibility with DOS applications</strong></p>
