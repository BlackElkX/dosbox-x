            <ul>
<li>
Improved internal Voodoo card hardware emulation,
such as fixing the font issue with the 3dfx version
of Tomb Raider when using non-Glide mode. Portions
of the code are ported from DOSBox ECE. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
Added OpenGL shader support by porting the feature
from DOSBox SVN. GLSL shaders are now supported in
both SDL1 and SDL2 builds, and this also allows
pixel-perfect scaling to be enabled for the OpenGL
outputs. The config option "glshader" (in [render]
section) can be used to specify a GLSL shader file
or a built-in shader when the output is set to
"opengl" or "openglnb". For example, you can use
the setting "glshader=sharp" (built-in shader) or
"glshader=pixel_perfect" (with GLSL shader file)
for the pixel-perfect scaling mode. The Windows
installer will also copy several GLSL shader files
to the "glshaders" subdirectory of the DOSBox-X
install directory to be used directly. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
Support for FluidSynth MIDI Synthesizer is now
included in the Windows Visual Studio builds by
default. Set "mididevice=fluidsynth" and a sound
font (e.g. GeneralUser_GS.sf2) to use it. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
Updated the MUNT MT32 emulation library to its
latest version 2.4.0. A few new MT32 config options
(starting with "mt32.") are added to [midi] section
of the DOSBox-X configuration. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
The DOSMID and MPXPLAY programs have been built
into DOSBox-X, both can be found on the Z drive and
feature full-screen user interfaces with support
for command-line usages (use /? option for help).
DOSMID can play MIDI/RMI/MUS audio files, whereas
MPXPLAY is a powerful and flexible audio player
with support for a variety of formats including
AAC/AC3/APE/FLAC/MP2/MP3/MPC/OGG/WAV and more with
playlist support. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
The mounting options "Mount as Hard Disk", "Mount
as CD-ROM", "Mount as Floppy", "Mount disk image"
and "Boot from disk image" (previously only for
Windows) in the "Drive" menu and the "Quick launch
program..." in the "DOS" menu are now available
for non-Windows platforms as well. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
Added "Shared Windows clipboard functions" menu
group under "Main", which allows you to enable
or disable the different ways for DOSBox-X to
communicate with the Windows clipboard. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
Added config option "dos clipboard api" in [dos]
section to control whether to enable the DOS APIs
for communications with the Windows clipboard for
DOS applications. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
Added config option "clip_mouse_button" to select
a mouse button (middle, right, or none; with right
mouse button being the default) for copying to and
pasting from the Windows clipboard. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
The mouse wheel movements will be automatically
converted into up/down arrows by default for the
intergrated DOS now. You can also enable it for
the guest system from the "Main" menu ("mouse wheel
movements" -> "Enable for guest systems also") or
from the config file. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
Added "Emulate CPU speed" menu group (under "CPU")
to emulate the speed of a specific CPU class. The
cycles to emulate are approximations of the actual
CPU hardware, and they are available thanks to data
provided by the user maximus105. Also added config
option "cycle emulation percentage adjust" in [cpu]
section for users who would like to make relative
percentage adjustments (between -25% and 25%) in
case it is necessary. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
Added SORT command from FreeDOS. It can be used to
sort input, e.g. "TYPE FILE.TXT | SORT". (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
Added DELTREE command to delete a directory and all
the subdirectories and files in it as in a real DOS
system. Please use it with caution. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
The command for starting the Configuration Tool has
been renamed from "SHOWGUI" to "CFGTOOL". A new
command-line option -gui is added to CONFIG command
to start the Configuration Tool as well. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
DOSBox-X now includes ZIP.EXE and UNZIP.EXE from
InfoZip for zipping and unzipping files in DOS.
Both programs will appear on the Z drive. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
The powerful DOS CD player called SJGPLAY has been
built into DOSBox-X. You can now find the program
CDPLAY.EXE in the Z drive for playing Audio CDs in
DOS, which supports both graphical and command-line
usage, and you will also find a text file named
CDPLAY.TXT in the Z drive for a quick usage guide.
A zip package including full documentation and some
extras will additionally appear as SJGPLAY.ZIP in
the Z drive. This freeware program was written by
Steve Gray and is now included in DOSBox-X with
explicit permission of the author. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
DOSBox-X will now by default show a quit warning
if a DOS program or game, or a guest system is
running. The previous behavior can be set with
"quit warning=autofile". (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
The welcome banner when DOSBox-X starts has been
improved for a better looking and should provide
more helpful instructions for users. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
Add new "Help" menu which includes menu items
"Introduction", "DOSBox-X homepage", "DOSBox-X Wiki
guide", "DOSBox-X support" and "About". (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
Improved the message when automatically re-running
the executable which failed with the "Packed file
is corrupt" error. Also added the "autoloadfix"
config option which when set to "false" will not
automatically re-run such programs. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
The display for several section names in DOSBox-X's
graphical configuration tool has been capitalized
or modified otherwise to look better. A default
shortcut key HOST(F11/F12)+C is added for starting
the graphical configuration tool. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
Added the "Show advanced options" checkbox in the
main screen of the Configuration GUI to toggle
whether to display all config options for the
sections. If unchecked (default), it will show
common config options instead of all of them. A
new config option "show advanced options" is added
which when set to "true" will make the checkbox
checked by default. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
Added code to cap the scan line length given to
the VESA BIOS given the video mode. This prevents
VBETEST.EXE from doing test patterns smaller than
the actual display, which can happen with 32bpp
320x200 modes and 1MB or less video RAM.
</li>
<li>
VESA BIOS Set Scan Line Length fixed to properly
report and handle scan line length for 16-color
SVGA planar modes. VBETEST 16-color modes now
display correctly.
</li>
<li>
Added option to control whether VESA BIOS panning
(the original VBE call) waits for vsync.
</li>
<li>
Moved video related config options from [dosbox]
section to its own [video] section. These options
in existing config files will be automatically
redirected to the [video] section from the [dosbox]
section when DOSBox-X starts. Windows installer can
also move such config options from existing config
files automatically. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
Cleared modem phone book before parsing it. Thank
NicknineTheEagle for the improvement.
</li>
<li>
Improved the help message of MOUNT command. Also
added option -examples to show its usage examples,
similar to IMGMOUNT and IMGMAKE commands. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
Fixed freeze when trying to reboot the internal
DOS when using a different code page and it is in
CGA or EGA emulation modes. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
DOSBox-X will now try to use the internal DOS date
and time (instead of always using the host date and
date) for file modication timestamps. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
Added menu item "Expanded memory (EMS)" under "DOS"
menu to dynamically enable or disable EMS memory
at run-time. You can now also modify EMS memory
with CONFIG command from command-line. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
Added config option "drive z hide files" (in [dos]
section) to hide or remove files listed (separated
by spaces) from the Z drive. If a file has a "/"
prefix (e.g. "/INTRO.COM"), then the specified file
will have the hidden attribute ("DIR /A" will list
all such files) instead of completely disappearing
from the Z drive. (Wengier)
</li>
<li>
You can now add your own programs or files to the
Z drive! Put your programs or files in the drivez
directory located in the DOSBox-X program folder
or the DOSBox-X configuration directory, and they
will automatically appear on the Z drive. If any of
the files have the same names as the built-in ones,
they will replace the built-in files. For example,
you can replace the built-in EDIT.COM and XCOPY.EXE
programs (from FreeDOS) with MS-DOS counterparts.
Windows installer will now automatically create a
drivez directory with a README.TXT file in it too.
For subdirectories support please use MOUNT command
to mount local directory instead. (Wengier).
